# UI: Label

Label is text used to describe another widget

```jsx
import * as RW from 'reactware';
```

<Playground className="Rw_UI_Buttons_Split dark_theme">
  <Rw.UI.Label>Label</Rw.UI.Label>
</Playground>

Labels are best used along side for elements such as textarea as once clicked they can focus an input.

> Note: This will be deprecated, as soon as [form layout](#layout/form) is added.

<Playground className="Rw_UI_Label dark_theme">
  <Rw.Layouts.Grid columns="2" centerleft widths="35px auto">
    <Rw.UI.Label htmlFor="my-input">Label</Rw.UI.Label>
    <Rw.UI.Textarea id="my-input" />
  </Rw.Layouts.Grid>
</Playground>

<PropsTable of={Rw.UI.Label} />
